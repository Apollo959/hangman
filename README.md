# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Milestone 2

Added a file 'milestone_2.py' which does the following:
    -- Creates a list of words based on fruit
    -- Chooses one at random using the random package
    -- asks the user for a single letter input
    -- verifies the users input is just one letter

# Milestone 3

Added the file 'milestone_3.py' which does the following:
    -- Generates a random word for the user to guess
    -- includes an 'ask_for_input' function which prompts the user to guess a letter
    -- includes a 'check_guess' function which is called to make sure the guess is a valid single character.
