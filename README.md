# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Milestone 2

Added a file 'milestone_2.py' which does the following:
    - Creates a list of words based on fruit
    - Chooses one at random using the random package
    - asks the user for a single letter input
    - verifies the users input is just one letter
